The Salesforce project creates a Student Attendance and Performance Tracker for colleges, replacing manual processes with a centralized system for attendance, exam results, alerts, and dashboards. Key stakeholders include faculty for marking attendance/results, students for tracking, management for reports, and optionally parents for notifications.
